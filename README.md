This is a Gorgy-style clock. It is intended for use in b2g so it will only work in firefox (although making it work in webkit should be a matter of adding the associated prefixes).

There aren't many knobs to turn yet but it's built in a highly configurable way,
so it should be easy to tweak the style to your liking.
